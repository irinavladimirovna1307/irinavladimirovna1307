# 👋 Hi, I'm Ira

I'm learning how to turn lines of code into clear and engaging user interfaces.  
Currently diving into frontend development — starting with **HTML/CSS**, getting comfortable with **JavaScript**, and soon stepping into the world of **React**.

I enjoy clean code, minimalistic design, and building things that just make sense. Every new project is a step forward.
